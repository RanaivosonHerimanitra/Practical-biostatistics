# Practical-biostatistics
At a certain point of my life, I need to showcase and distribute what I've learned from previous work experience and hundreds of gigabytes of MOOCs. So I decided to make it available for everyone. This book is written using _bookdown_ package and presents a curated list of resources for statisticians, social scientists, biologists, students involved in data analysis and interpretation tasks such as inferential statistics, Bioinformatics. All with straightforward application using R and/or Python programming languages.
# Roadmap:

* Probability distribution

* Type of uncertainty and statistical power (not sure It will become a chapter)

* Usual Statistical tests by type of variables

* Usual Statistical tests by goals

* Non parametric versus parametric test approach (not sure It will become a chapter)

* Study design in traditional surveys

* Study design in clinical trials (Epidemiological studies)

* Statistical modelling and data analysis in Epidemiology

* Application in development economics (not sure It will become a chapter)
