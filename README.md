# Practical-biostatistics
At a certain point of my life, I need to showcase and distribute what I've learned from previous work experience and hundreds of gigabytes of MOOCs. So I decided to make it available for everyone. This book is written using _bookdown_ package and presents a curated list of resources for statisticians, social scientists, biologists, students involved in data analysis and interpretation tasks such as inferential statistics, Bioinformatics. All with straightforward application using R and/or Python programming languages.
